README is what attracts developers/visitors to view your project. If your README contains just plain text, AHHH, it‚Äôs not convincing. It is like subject books as you grow up; with less pictures, small font, large paras and no interest. I guess it is not just me who used to search for pictures in the book to estimate how interesting it would be, how much I would read it in future, or if I would even touch it.

If I write this blog without any picturesüñºÔ∏è, same sized fontüî§, no separations, no humorü§°, no anecdotes; in short no interest‚ùå; I am technically writing it in vain. It‚Äôs not gonna get sold and I am gonna remain poor. POOR MEüò≠. I don‚Äôt know how much interesting I can make this blog but I hope it can help you.

README is the face of your project and you need to apply the best makeup on to make it look sufficiently presentable so you won‚Äôt loose YOUR FACE. So, let‚Äôs start and get to know what all we have for the MAKEUP and how to apply it.

Makeup Kit includes :-

Headings
Linebreaks
Emphasis
Blockquotes
Don‚Äôt render Code
Lists ‚Äî ordered and unordered
Horizontal rules
Links
Images/GIF
Video
Labels
Tables
Task List
Add Color
Write text as code
Add Emoji
All in one kit. No better place to go. Let‚Äôs begin

1. Headings
Same as in HTML, here you have 6 headings.

Code :-

# Heading1
## Heading2
### Heading3
#### Heading4
##### Heading5
###### Heading6


Headings
A line is given by default for Heading1 and Heading2. Others are without it.

2. Line Breaks
For a line break or writing to a new line you can either opt the markdown way or the HTML way. Both works fine.

Markdown :- To create a line break, end a line with two or more spaces, and hit enter.

Markdown Way
of breaking

Sorry, they won‚Äôt allow more than 1 space here so copy pasting the above code won‚Äôt work for you.

HTML :- Just add the break tag (<br>)

HTML way <br>
of breaking


Line Breaks
3. Emphasis
Bold and Italic are the 2 emphasis modes. It adds a little weight to your monotonous text.

Bold :- Doubles are for bold

**Bold**
__Bold__

Italic :- Singles are for italic

*Italic*
_Italic_

What if we want both, a HYBRID ?

***Hybrid***
___Hybird___
**_Hybrid_**
*__Hybrid__*


4. Blockquotes
Blockquotes are quotes that are set off from the main text as a paragraph, or block of text.

Code :- (The > on 2nd line is for an empty line in output)

> This is a blockquote
>
> This is next line


Nested Blockquote

> This is main Blockquote
> >This is nested Blockquote
> >
> >Let‚Äôs get out of nested
>
> Let‚Äôs get out of main


5. Code
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt render it. I said DON‚ÄôT. Keep it as a code.‚Äù

Write the code and give a tab to all, i.e. 4 spaces. Indent them by 4 spaces to keep them as a normal text. If you don‚Äôt indent it, it will be read as an HTML block.

Code :- (More than 1 space not allowed here)

<html>
<body>
<p>Let‚Äôs keep it as a code block and not render it for once</p>
</body>
</html>


6. Lists
Lists are very necessary for README like when you want to list the features, or languages used, etc.

Unordered List :-

* Item1
* Item2
* Item3

- Item1
- Item2
- Item3


Ordered List :-

1. Item1
2. Item2
3. Item3


7. Horizontal Rules
To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___).

---

****

_______


8. Links
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses. You can also simply copy paste a link.

[Link to Portfolio Website](https://gaganpreetkaurkalsi.netlify.app/)


Output
Link with title :-

[Link to Portfolio Website](https://gaganpreetkaurkalsi.netlify.app ‚ÄúMy Portfolio Website‚Äù)


When you hover over, the title is shown
9. Images
Images are very important to make your README attractive.

To place an image,

upload it to your repository
mention its path in the below given markdown
![Alt](path to img)

![Image](/component-library/images/website.svg)

GIF ‚Äî You can also upload a GIF. Just mention its link in place of image link. The syntax remains same.

![Main](https://media.giphy.com/media/wKoPDy4mp8Lr6IJ9ce/giphy.gif)


website.svg displayed in README
You can also drag and drop an image in the README. This feature has been added recently.


Sorry for the poor quality
10. Video
Same as Image you can upload a video to your README. Make a short video of your project and paste it to gain more viewers.


Drag and Drop. It‚Äôs as simple as that
11. Labels
Here is code to a few labels below. Feel free to use. Mention your Github Username and repository name in the space mentioned.

![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/{username}/{repo-name}/total)
![GitHub language count](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/count/{username}/{repo-name})
